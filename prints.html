				<p><strong>Photoshop Processing</strong> — Adobe Photoshop (2020): For this project, I picked 2 or 3 images to use in the background and used clipping masks in Adobe Photoshop to insert sections of some images into the text. Each image has phrases or lyrics of the songs that I like (most of them are from church services).<br><br><a href="Photos and Animations/Prints/BN_Ps_Processing1 copy.jpg">When You Let It Shine</a> - This image shows a shinning full moon in the night sky. The lyrics are from the song, Make It Shine, from Victorious.<br><a href="Photos and Animations/Prints/BN_Ps_Processing2 copy.jpg">Lets Give Our Thanks</a> - The phrase and the images represents Thanksgiving theme (Turkeys and pumpkins)<br><a href="Photos and Animations/Prints/BN_Ps_Processing3 copy.jpg">I Worship You Forevermore</a> - These lyrics are one of the songs used in church services.<br><a href="Photos and Animations/Prints/BN_Ps_Processing4 copy.jpg">Will You Meet Me Here Again</a> - These lyrics are one of the songs used in church services. I used the clipping masks to apply the yellow bird on the upper right.<br><a href="Photos and Animations/Prints/BN_Ps_Processing5 copy.jpg">Praise The Father Praise The Sun</a> - I used the clipping masks for the text and owl. This lyrics are also the title of the songs used in church services (Note: The last word in the lyrics, "sun", is a typo. It’s supposed to be "son").</p>
